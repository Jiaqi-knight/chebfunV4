function s = curl(f)
%CURL curl of a chebfun2v
% 
% S = CURL(F) returns the chebfun2 of the curl of F. If F is a chebfun2v 
% with two components then it returns the chebfun2 representing 
%
%         curl(F) = F(2)_x - F(1)_y,
%
% where F = (F(1),F(2)).  If F is a chebfun2v with three components then it
% returns the chebfun2v representing the 3D curl operation.

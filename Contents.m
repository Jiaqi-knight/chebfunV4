% Chebfun
% Version 3.1111 3-May-2010
%
% Chebfun extends familiar powerful methods of numerical
% computation involving numbers to continuous or piecewise-continuous
% functions.  It also implements continuous analogues of linear algebra
% notions like the QR decomposition and the SVD.  The mathematical basis of
% Chebfun combines tools of Chebyshev expansions, fast Fourier
% transform, barycentric interpolation, Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature, and
% recursive zerofinding.

% installation directory.

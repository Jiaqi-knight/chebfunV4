%% ODEs with Dirac-Delta functions on the RHS
% Chebfun can now solve ODEs with delta functions on the right-hand side.
% To solve the problem, $$ Lu = \delta(x-x_0), $$ where $L$ is a linear
% differential operator, we convert this distributional problem to a
% classical problem with appropriate boundary conditions. Specifically, if
% $L$ is an $n^{th}$ order linear operator, we enforce continuity of $u$
% and its first $n-2$ derivatives and a jump of appropriate magnitude in
% the $(n-1)^{st}$ derivative of $u$ at the location of the delta function
% $x_0$ [2]. Once this is done, Chebfun considers the problem as a BVP with
% interior boundary conditions. Thanks to Nick Hale, Chebfun has
% capabilities to solve such problems. (See for example [3]).

%%
% Let's start with a very simple example. We know that the derivative of
% the Heaviside function is the delta function. We can now solve $u'(x) =
% \delta(x)$ in Chebfun to get the same result:
x = chebfun('x');
L = chebop(@(u) diff(u)); L.lbc = 0;
u = L\dirac(x);
plot(u), ylim([-.2 1.2])

%%
% We can also have multiple delta functions on the RHS.
u = L\(dirac(x+.5)+dirac(x)+dirac(x-.5));
plot(u), ylim([-.2 3.2])

%%
% We can mix delta functions with other classical functions and 
% solve the same differential equation for a slightly interesting
% right-hand side.
u = L\(4*cos(4*pi*x)+ dirac(x+.75)-2*dirac(x)+dirac(x-.75));
plot(u)

%%
% Applying the differential operator to the solution gives us back
% the forcing function.
plot(L(u))

%%
% We now move on to second order operators. The so called hat function can
% be written as a solution of a BVB with delta functions on the RHS.
L = chebop( @(h) diff(h,2) ); L.lbc = 0; L.rbc = 0;
hat = L\(dirac(x-.5)-2*dirac(x)+dirac(x+.5));
plot(hat)

%%
% The solution is pretty accurate:
norm(hat-max(0,1/2*(1-abs(2*x))),inf)
%%
% We can again recover the RHS of the ODE by applying the operator
% to the solution.
plot(L(hat)), ylim([-2.2 1.2])

%% Impulse Response of an Electrical Network
% Here is a practical example from electrical circuit theory. A four
% terminal RLC-network is modelled by a second order differential equation
% with constant coefficients. We now find the impulse response of such a
% network:
d = domain([0 1]);
x = chebfun('x', d);
L = chebop(@(u) diff(u,2)+20*diff(u)+10000*u, d);
L.lbc = @(u) [diff(u),u];
u = L\dirac(x); plot(x,u), hold on
%%
% The solution obtained agrees with the exact solution.
a = 10; w = sqrt(9900);
uexact = 1/w*exp(-a*x).*sin(w*x);
hold on,
plot(x,uexact,'r.'), hold off
norm(u-uexact,inf)

%% The Infinite Rod with Absorption
% We now solve an example given in [pp 83, 1]. The aim is to
% investigate the concentration of a diffusing substance in a
% homogeneous absorbing rod of infinite length. This gives 
% rise to a second order ODE on an infinite domain. Assuming that
% the concentration will decay to zero quickly for points far away
% from the sources, we can take a suitably large interval as
% the domain with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions.
d = domain(-50, 50);
x = chebfun('x',d);
L = chebop(@(u) -diff(u,2)+u,d);
L.lbc = 0; L.rbc = 0;

%%
% In particular, we consider the case when the density of the
% diffusing substance is a simple point source at the origin.
% The point source can be conveniently modelled as a delta
% function. Therefore the solution is given by:
u = L\dirac(x);
plot(u), hold on

%%
% To check the accuracy, we compare the computed solution with
% the exact solution 
uexact = 1/2*exp(-abs(x));
plot(uexact, '.r'), hold off
norm(u-uexact,inf)

%% ODEs with Generalized Solutions
% A linear homogeneous differential equation with analytic and non-singular 
% coefficients does not have generalized solutions other than the classical
% solutions. However for an equation with singular coefficients, we sometimes
% can get new generalized solutions [2]. For example, let us consider the
% confluent hypergeometric equation $$ xy''+(2-x)y'-y=0. $$ It is known that $y(x) =
% \delta(x)$ is a solution of this equation [2]. We can verify this
% easily in Chebfun as well. It is important to remember that a chebfun
% F stores delta functions and its derivatives in the F.imps field.
x = chebfun('x'); y = dirac(x);
y.imps
%%
% The first row of the imps matrix contains function values
% at break points while the second row indicates the presence
% of delta functions. Plugging $y$ in the differential equation
% yields:
r = x.*diff(y,2)+(2-x).*diff(y)-y; 
r.imps

%%
% We can also check that
norm(r,inf)

%%
% $\delta(x)$ is also a solution of the Bessel's equation
% $$x^2y''+xy'+(x^2-1)y=0.$$ Again, we can verify this easily.
r = x.^2.*diff(y,2)+x.*diff(y)+(x.^2-1).*y;
r.imps

%%
% Finally we verify that $\delta(x)-\delta'(x)$ solves
% $$ xy''+(3-x)y'-y=0. $$
y = dirac(x)-dirac(x,1);
r = x.*diff(y,2)+(3-x).*diff(y)-y;
r.imps
norm(r,inf)

%LOBPTS  Gauss-Legendre-Lobatto Quadrature Nodes and Weights.
%  LOBPTS(N) returns N Legendre-Lobatto points X in (-1,1).
%
%  [X,W] = LOBPTS(N) returns also a row vector W of weights for
%  Gauss-Legendre-Lobatto quadrature.
%
%  [X,W,V] = LOBPTS(N) returns additionally a column vector V of weights in
%  the barycentric formula corresponding to the points X. The weights are
%  scaled so that max(abs(V)) = 1.
%
%  [X,W] = LOBPTS(N,METHOD) allows the user to select which method to use.
%    METHOD = 'REC' uses the recurrence relation for the Legendre 
%       polynomials and their derivatives to perform Newton iteration 
%       on the WKB approximation to the roots. Default for N < 100.
%    METHOD = 'ASY' uses the Hale-Townsend fast algorithm based up
%       asymptotic formulae, which is fast and accurate. Default for 
%       N >= 100.
%    METHOD = 'GLR' uses the Glaser-Liu-Rokhlin fast algorithm [2], which
%       is fast and can give better relative accuracy for the -.5<x<.5
%       than 'ASY' (although the accuracy of the weights is usually worse).
%    METHOD = 'GW' will use the traditional Golub-Welsch eigenvalue method, 
%       which is maintained mostly for historical reasons.
